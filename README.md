# Scale

**Scale** is a minimalist incremental game focused on distance, scale, and layered progression.

You generate distance automatically, prestige into Scale Points, and unlock new systems that feed back into earlier layers. Progression is linear, but lateral. Systems remain relevant instead of being discarded.

The game emphasizes:
- Large numbers and scientific notation
- Logarithmic scaling for long-term balance
- Minimal UI and low cognitive load
- Multiple interacting prestige layers
